# According to the checkpoint, the model was trained with:
num_visible = 320   # Total number of visible units
num_hidden = 80     # Total number of hidden units
checkpoint_path = "checkpoint.pth"

# --- LOAD THE MODEL ---
model = RBM(num_visible=num_visible, num_hidden=num_hidden)
checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location="cpu", weights_only=False)
rbm_state = checkpoint["rbm_state_dict"]

# Manually load weights adjusting for shape mismatches:
# Checkpoint's weight matrix 'W' has shape [320, 80] (visible x hidden)
# but your model expects shape [80, 320], so we transpose.
model.W.data = rbm_state["W"].t()

# The checkpoint's visible bias 'a' is scalar (shape [1]); expand it to match num_visible.
model.a.data = rbm_state["a"].expand(num_visible)
# Hidden bias 'b' can be loaded as is.
model.b.data = rbm_state["b"]

# --- EXTRACT AND NORMALIZE WEIGHTS ---
# Get W, which now has shape [80, 320]: each row is a filter for one hidden unit.
